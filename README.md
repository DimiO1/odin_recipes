# Thoughts
Building a website using all the HTML skills that I have learnt. I learnt how to clone a repository and create files in the command line. Got comfortable with commit messages and using git to push my projects to my Github. Used semantic tags for better SEO and it makes it easier to read as to how the structure of your webpage is structured.
